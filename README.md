# Internship
Work from Columbia University research internship under Ivan Corwin.

BrownWalk: Simulation of Brownian Motion as a scaling limit of a symmetric 2-dimensional random walk.
ExpDis: Toy project, simulation of two competing exponential random variables.
Flippy: Large-time simulation of Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Principle (ASEP), over various sizes and values of the temperature parameter.
Ising: Visualization of the Kac-Ising model at various values of the temperature parameter using the Glauber dynamic.
PointProcess: Investigation of Poisson point processes, as well as processes with time-varying rates.
Tetris: Visualization of random tetris, and study of growth of interface as time grows large.
